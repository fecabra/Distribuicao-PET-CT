Distances to PET-CT diagnostic equipment need to be reduced so that patients
can have a rapid diagnosis of diseases, and as a consequence, have a greater chance of
survival through early detection and initiation of treatment. Therefore, this study will
address the analysis of how PET-CT equipment is distributed in the Brazilian territory
and what should be done to improve the population's access to it. Plotting data on maps
for visualization and analysis of results showed that Brazil has an insufficient amount of
PET-CTs to adequately meet the demands of the population in relation to specific
diagnostic tests, provided only by this equipment. So, a proposal for locating new
equipment was made using the Location-allocation Problem solver through the methods
Minimize Weighted Impedance (P-Median), Maximize Coverage, Maximize Attendance.
The algorithm in Python language was executed inside a notebook in the ArcGIS Pro
Desktop software environment, and as a result, within the parameters introduced, it
indicated a necessity of 512 additional equipments to the 119 already existing in the
country. Besides that, due to the heterogeneity of the Brazilian territory, 15.403.911
inhabitants were without access to a PET-CT within the restrictions determined in the
algorithm.
